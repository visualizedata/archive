Generalizing the search queries, in addition to creating a placeholder graphic for items with rights-managed images allowed me to broaden my dataset as much as possible without encountering any "null" values or other missing pieces.

For poets and writers, the formal complexity, beauty, and radical inventiveness of Dante\u2019s poetry has opened countless pathways for remaking and reconceiving the written word. This project draws inspiration specifically from Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, the great 20th century fabulists, each of whom regarded Dante as a touchstone for the visual and spatial imagination. This project seeks to extend these speculations, inspirations, and reimaginations into the emergent 21st century paradigms of knowledge generation: the three-dimensional interactive capabilities of the graphical user interface, and the n-dimensional dynamics of data transit. Built in JavaScript, using the Threejs 3D library and a MongoDB database, this speculative map of Dante\u2019s poetic space serves as an environment for active, exploratory, deep, and collaborative reading of the poem. My central questions are: How can poetic space be visualized? And how can such a visualization lead us to new modes of reading, understanding, imagination, and expression?",student_url:"http://www.floatingmedia.com/",project_url:"https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2016/jonThirkield/",project_repo:"https://github.com/jthirkield/thesis",category:["thesis"],tags:["arts","leisure"],year:2016,image:["preview-2016/jonathan.png"],video:["https://github.com/jthirkield/thesis/blob/master/screenpics/DanteInfernoScreenRecording.mov?raw=true"]},{author:["Justine Keller"],title:"Leadership Gender Gap",subtitle:"While 92% of girls believe anyone can acquire the skills of leadership, only 21% believe they currently have most of the key qualities required to be a good leader...",description:"While 92% of girls believe anyone can acquire the skills of leadership, only 21% believe they currently have most of the key qualities required to be a good leader (Schoenberg, Salmond, Fleshman, 2008).

In the United States, a gender gap exists in political leadership. Although women gained the right to vote 97 \u201Cyear\u201Ds ago, in federal and state politics women hold fewer than 20% of seats in congress (Pew Research Center, 2015). Girls and women are often not viewed in society as strong leaders, not only by boys and men, but equally by women themselves. Society needs to become aware of these false perceptions of female leaders and their negative impact on political representation. This visualization contrasts the perspectives of women, men, boys, and girls to the number of men and women in various political entities.

The machine learning models are then compared to human evaluations of emotions, based on existing psychoanalytic research. Results indicate that machine learning models are able to adequately predict the emotions in novels and generate supporting book cover art.

 Inventions are signals from the future, as much as they are from the past. They provide us with a barometer for measuring the patterns of economic activity, policy direction, and competitive moat-building by international companies and governments across the world. These visual explorations will serve to connect policy makers, investors, entrepreneurs and academic commercialization offices with opportunities to make better decisions, bring ideas to market, and grow the economy sustainably within the United States.

 Without mentioning the communities affected by the dispersion of AI technologies would be a great disservice. There is an even greater need for accelerating education within underrepresented communities; where patents are not being filed. I argue for an increasing need to create an international definition for AI-assisted inventions, and for the creation of an intellectual property commons, which is funded by corporate profitability of AI technologies in order to address the shorter-term inequalities which will result from the displacement due to skills-bias, and other labor demand asymmetries. Redistribution from gains within the short-term will help buffer the problems created by these technologies. I\u2019m optimistic that the advances created by AI as seen through this patent landscape will be a net positive for more developed countries, and there needs to be a framework established to help developing nations and underrepresented communities to benefit in the long-term as well.`,student_url:"https://github.com/leeallennyc",project_url:"https://leeallennyc.github.io/signalsfromthefuture",project_repo:"https://github.com/leeallennyc/thesis",category:["thesis"],tags:["technology","policy"],year:2021,image:["preview-2021/lee.png"],video:["https://github.com/leeallennyc/thesis/blob/main/demo.mp4?raw=true"]},{author:["Qinglu (Luella) Lu"],title:"Spill the Boba Tea",subtitle:"How Asian Are You?

It should be noted that there are other types of climbing, including: top-rope; ice-climbing; mountaineering and trad climbing; free solo and deep water solo. We will analyze several aspects of climbing, including what the records and benchmarks are for climbing routes, what the various grading systems are (how climbs are measured); what makes a climb hard; how climbers get stronger; and other aspects such as the increase in popularity of the sport over time, and accompanying research and literature.

The first is how unique words are used in each song. This shows how diversely words are adapted to convey meaning. More unique words used in a song create more diversity and more complexity. The approach to measure the level of diversity in vocabulary is achieved by counting the unique instances of words: for example, if a certain word appears more than twice in a song, only the first instance is counted, leaving the duplicates out of the word pool.

The second is how broad the listeners\u2019 vocabulary would have to be. This focuses on how various subjects such as gender fluidity and homosexuality, are dealt with in songs as well as how different topics are interpreted in each song. Today, these new topics require new vocabulary because in the past, they did not exist in the general public sphere. In addition to the quantitative analysis of absolute word count that will be presented in this paper, proportion analysis will also be included : how much percentile is covered by having certain coverage or word. For example, by covering the top 10% of used vocabulary, we can estimate how much percentage of vocabulary is covered in a certain decade.

To analyze trends over time, this project covers hip hop songs from the first advent of it (1980) to the songs of today(up to 2020). The user is able to compare the changes by navigating dispersion patterns visually by decade and also to see what is the general pattern of vocabulary by seeing the generative art form of word dispersion.

 Since this project shows an aspect of pop culture linguistically, the vinyl player interface is adopted as a visual inspiration.

This critique is then extended to our own "disinformation age." The roles of pattern recognition and time pressure are examined across these very different scenarios with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics, and cognitive psychology.

Information exchange in the contemporary world is constant and new fashion trends or patterns emerge and are influenced by a variety of sources. Fashion change over time cannot be explained by a particular theory, catalyst or cycle. Forecasting future trends is a complex process as drivers of change in fashion culture are vast and patterns in the fashion cycle are difficult to discern. This data visualization explores the popularity of past trends and aims to identify a pattern in a subset of styles that have been recycled throughout the years. Data from the archives of Vogue, a globally celebrated and recognized fashion magazine, is collected over roughly 140 years for a subset of 20 iconic styles. The data visualization synthesizes the number of times a particular style appears in a Vogue magazine edit during a decade and illustrates the popularity of a style during that time period. Research of fashion history and theory as well as social, cultural and technological factors throughout this thesis builds on the visualization\u2019s trend analysis with the hope of better understanding what drives changes in fashion culture.

During the first epidemic, pharmaceutical companies and federal regulations laid the groundwork for the stigmatization of opioid addiction that created an isolating environment for those struggling with opioid dependence today. Accessible recovery in conjunction with de-stigmatizing what was left by the earlier epidemic is needed to prevent future devastation and build a system that can prevent history from repeating itself once again.

So you might think that for the most part, this toxic substance is a thing of the past. Despite the hard fought fight by researchers educating the public about the harm of lead-lead based paint, children still wind up in the hospital with lead poisoning. At this point, it\u2019s clear that despite the ban, the US government has failed to protect residents from this detrimental environmental harm. I ask, how can clothing be used to re-visualize the harm of lead paint exposure. Children who are chronically exposed to lead paint face permanent physical brain structure changes that make processing information and decision making difficult even long after the lead has cleared from the body. My hope is that by using this jacket, and transcending the screen I\u2019m able to offer a multi sensory experience that will only deepen our understanding of the life long effects of lead paint. But this physicalization isn\u2019t the whole picture of lead paint exposure. I encourage you to visit my project site where you\u2019ll be able to learn more about the jacket, its meaning, the status quo of lead paint in New York City, as well as the populations that are most at risk.
