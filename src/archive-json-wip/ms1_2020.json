    "description": "In Buddhism art, the image of the historical Buddha is often labeled \u201cShakyamuni\u201d. This distinguishes the image of the historical Buddha, or cosmic buddhas, bodhisattvas, or other divine beings. Buddha images vary greatly from place to place and period to period, but they almost always show some conventional features. So this interactive piece aims to visualize those universal features that a Buddha contains. The bubble groups give you an idea of the Buddhism art collections from the Smithsonian.  By using a 3D sculpture, I want to mimic an immersive experience like you are standing inside a museum, like the National Museum of Asian Art, Smithsonian.",

    "description": "This project proposes a unique user-driven way of browsing a museum collection in the digital space. Mexican Masks in the Smithsonian Institution Archives were chosen as the subject matter because humans have extremely high recognition of faces even when presented at lower resolution as seen in the mosaic. It\u2019s worth noting that the allusion of having a mask masked by another mask was also considered as a design choice. A Mosaic was created using the base p5js library in order to realize these goals. Elements of interactivity were introduced so that users can select any of the \u2018small images\u2019 to force a redraw where that image was the \u2018main mosaic image\u2019. This allows individuals to jump through different images of museum items based on their desire to manifest realistic mask mosaics. Furthermore a bounded scroll window was created so that users can zoom in to the mosaic to view the \u2018smaller images\u2019 at full resolution.The result is a digital experience that allows users to browse the collection of masks through the lens of their curiosity.",

    "description": "An Interactive map and visualization tool for exploring The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History's Mineral Sciences collection. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History's Mineral Sciences collection consists of hundreds of thousands of gems and minerals. The museum's digital archives provided geolocation points and other data for the 656 items found in the interactive map featured here. The visualization at bottom left portions out the collection into a set of common colors, and allows you to explore the material accordingly. This involved creating a node script that analyzed the the text descriptions of each gem and sorting them by key words matched to 20 different color groups. With numerous ways of describing something that is \"yellowish green\", this helped to make the data more accessible while also giving the user a general idea of the over all shape, or in this case, \"color\" of the data. All items link directly to the collection record on the museum's website. This is especially helpful for the many items to which image rights applied. I learned over time that the structure of the Smithsonian's returned API data required a more adaptive approach to the data analysis than the rigid criteria I had begun with. For example, looking for the carat weight value in the same exact location of the data would often return \"null\" values. Generalizing the search queries, in addition to creating a placeholder graphic for items with rights-managed images allowed me to broaden my dataset as much as possible without encountering any \"null\" values or other missing pieces. This was especially important for the map, where the sparseness of the available data could quickly become an issue.",

This external database allowed me to use the data in an excel format to create the visualization.

Computer scientists and programmers, for example, use git to track changes in their codes repositories which are more often than not, entirely text-based. This gives us on opportunity to use the same mechanism for tracking changes the constitution. Git\u2019s version control allows tracking changes in a text document as it evolves; it tracks deletions, additions, and even follows separate silos in which draft is being developed via branches. I use git branches to visualise the changing text: in tree graphs and more specifically a directed acyclic graph .
