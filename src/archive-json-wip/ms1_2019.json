    "description": "Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality and temptation.\n\nDo artists just pick apple as a random fruit to depict in their artworks or is it highly associated with cultural significance? If it is then within Met\u2019s collection, which continent uses apple as a metaphor more than others? And which media is more popular being used to depict apples?",

I was ready to develop a web scraper then realized The Met has a really robust search function on their website that includes filters for department. The results were both unsurprising and surprising. I expected there to reveal usage of these words but was shocked by the prevalence of the word primitive, and that all but 300 of its 3506 uses appears in the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas department.",

    "description": "I am interested in forms of Catholic art, and The Met collection is rich and deep in this area.  In fact, The Met's collection is so deep, it can be overwhelming to a casual observer.\n\nI felt much of this sacred art is removed from its original context.  Many of The Met's objects have been presented in Cathedrals, and some even adorned high altars, making many of them central to worship.\n\nI wanted to see if using The Met's digital collection I could present the artwork within a narrative framework, and restore the potential for these items to be used as meditative aids.    The Rosary was the perfect vehicle;  it provides both narrative and a prayer context, and it has been used for centuries, including in our present day.   Many people at least may have heard of a Rosary,  even if they do not fully understand what it is or how it works.   Thus a third goal is established; to relate the art to a devotional practice in current use.",

Almost everybody has seen the images of the first moon landing taken by Neil Armstrong, or the first image of the earth known as \u00bbblue marble\u00ab.\nThe engagement with The Met\u2019s open access collection shows that the museum is also in possession of such iconographic documentation, although a lot of it is little known by public . \nAround 40 paintings by the Painter Robert Charles Dudley document the laying of the first transatlantic cables in the middle of the 18th century, a huge technological mission with impacts on the interconnected and global society we are today.\n\n\u2014 Paintings as diagrams\nThe goal of the visualization is to let the user enjoy the effects of the beautiful paintings and to augment these paintings with contextual and historical content at the same time. The paintings, grouped thematically, can be navigated as maps; the possibility to zoom gives the user control how to view the artifacts and clickable legends provide more insights about the contents of the paintings.",

    "description": "An experiment using existing art to make new art. And a new way to experience art. For this project I chose four 2D works of art from across a range of eras and departments at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and rendered each of them as a landscape or topographic map. I used Rembrandt\u2019s Self Portrait, Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue by Georgia O'Keeffe, Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 70 by Robert Motherwell, and A Rose by Thomas Anshutz. The final poster series shows each painting from straight-on (top down if you\u2019re thinking in 3D) isometric perspectives. The framing around the straight-on image indicates what the image looks like from all four sides. These images were then taken into Unity to create navigable landscapes in which the user can walk around the works of art.",
